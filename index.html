        <p><em><a href="https://itstimetospeakup227898752.wordpress.com/">Unpublished Author and Inexperienced writer</a>.</em></p>
        <p>I am one of many passions. I write, I have one left foot and possibly too much confidence for my own good. I was good at Sciences and Mathematics and yet studied a Social Science; <strong>Environmental Studies and Community
            Development</strong>. Presently, I am developing my web development and coding skills. Lastly, I believe myself to be pretty good at addressing mental health artistically through writing.</p>
